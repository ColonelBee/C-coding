# Mess up with C
### Nothing but playing with C in my free time:)
1. Converting unsigned or signed decimal number to its binary and hexadecimal forms: [convert.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/convert.c)
2. Concatenate one string after another with pointers: [cat.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/cat.c)
3. Checking bro's BMI with command line: [BMI.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/BMI.c)
4. ASM-like operations with add, sub, mul, div: [asm_like_operations.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/asm_like_operations.c)
