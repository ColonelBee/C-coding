# C coding
## Nothing but playing with C in my free time:)
1. Converting unsigned or signed decimal number to its binary and hexadecimal forms: [convert.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/convert.c)
2. Concatenate one string after the other with pointers: [cat.c](https://github.com/ColonelBee/C-coding/blob/main/cat.c)
